## Research and Development Intern
#### August 2018 - Mar 2019 | Beijing Institute of Technology
- Worked on magnetic resonance imaging **(MRI) data harmonization**. Developed algorithms to eliminate the differences caused by the scanner.
- Calculated RISH features from the original MRI signal. Based on that, realized a **linear data harmonization algorithm** and a **CNN machine-learning-based nonlinear algorithm**.
- The proposed algorithms harmonize the **raw signal** from scanners, eliminate the changes caused by scanners while **maintaining the fiber orientation** in human brain. Any derived quantity from the harmonized data can be pooled from different sites for **further medical analysis**.
- Tools and skills: Keras, machine learning, DIPY, NiBabel, Ants
