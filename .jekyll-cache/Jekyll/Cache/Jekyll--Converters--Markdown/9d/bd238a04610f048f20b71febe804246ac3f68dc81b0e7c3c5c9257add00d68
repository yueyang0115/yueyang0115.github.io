<h2>Research and Development Intern</h2>
<h4>August 2018 - Mar 2019 | Beijing Institute of Technology</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Worked on magnetic resonance imaging <strong>(MRI) data harmonization</strong>. Developed algorithms to eliminate the differences caused by the scanner.</li>
  <li>Calculated RISH features from the original MRI signal. Based on that, realized a <strong>linear data harmonization algorithm</strong> and a <strong>CNN machine-learning-based nonlinear algorithm</strong>.</li>
  <li>The proposed algorithms harmonize the <strong>raw signal</strong> from scanners, eliminate the changes caused by scanners while <strong>maintaining the fiber orientation</strong> in human brain. Any derived quantity from the harmonized data can be pooled from different sites for <strong>further medical analysis</strong>.</li>
  <li>Tools and skills: Keras, machine learning, DIPY, NiBabel, Ants</li>
</ul>
