<h2>Projects</h2>

<p>So youâ€™ve got a copy running and thereâ€™s some new update? Letâ€™s update!</p>

<ol>
  <li>Checkout your github-pages branch
    <ul>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git checkout gh-pages</code> for a standalone or existing page</li>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git checkout master</code> for a <em>username.github.io</em> page</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git remote | grep -q "singlepage" || git remote add -t publish singlepage https://github.com/t413/SinglePaged.git</code> to be sure you have access to this repository (you can run this command at any time).</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git fetch singlepage</code> to fetch-in-place new changes.</li>
  <li>Update to the new base (using merge)
    <ol>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git merge singlepage/publish</code></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>You can alternatively update using rebase. This <em>rewrites history</em> (<strong>bad</strong>), but it is cleaner.
    <ol>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git rebase singlepage/publish</code></li>
