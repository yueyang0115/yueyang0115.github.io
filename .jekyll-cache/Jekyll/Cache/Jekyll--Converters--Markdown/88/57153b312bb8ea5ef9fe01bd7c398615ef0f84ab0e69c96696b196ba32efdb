I"-<p>###<em>I have lots of experience with:</em></p>

<p>##MAGIC, COMEDY, JUGGLING, ESCAPES, PICK-POCKETING, MIND READING, AND MORE!</p>

<p>The best way to choose from all the great San Francisco magicians is to read
their reviews on Yelp, watch their videos on Youtube, and call them on the
phone to get a feel for their personality. Ask a lot of questions and if you
feel there is a good connection, that they explained what they do
clearly, and they understand your needs, then you have found your
entertainer.</p>

<p style="text-align:left">###<em>I offer:</em></p>

<ul class="square">
  <li><strong>Stand-Up Show</strong> - I can do a comedy magic show that lasts from 5 to 60 minutes (to fill the time that is best for your needs).</li>
  <li><strong>Master of Ceremonies</strong> - I can host, MC, moderate a panel discussion, be your auctioneer, and even be a ringmaster to keep your event running smoothly.</li>
  <li><strong>Multiple Shows</strong> - I can do the same show multiple times for different audiences or different shows for the same audience at your event.</li>
  <li><strong>Close-Up Magic</strong> - I can do magic up close and personal at your special event. It is also called strolling, mingling, walk-around, and atmosphere entertainment.</li>
  <li><strong>Large Illusions</strong> - I can perform a large illusion show with an assistant to make your VIP appear magically and to highlight your theme, message, and/or product.</li>
  <li><strong>Variety Show</strong> - I can provide a show with comedians, magicians, jugglers, acrobats, contorionists, and just about whatever you can think of. I will put it together with all of the great entertainers I have worked with over the years.</li>

<h2>Projects</h2>

<p>So you’ve got a copy running and there’s some new update? Let’s update!</p>

<ol>
  <li>Checkout your github-pages branch
    <ul>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git checkout gh-pages</code> for a standalone or existing page</li>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git checkout master</code> for a <em>username.github.io</em> page</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git remote | grep -q "singlepage" || git remote add -t publish singlepage https://github.com/t413/SinglePaged.git</code> to be sure you have access to this repository (you can run this command at any time).</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git fetch singlepage</code> to fetch-in-place new changes.</li>
  <li>Update to the new base (using merge)
    <ol>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git merge singlepage/publish</code></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>You can alternatively update using rebase. This <em>rewrites history</em> (<strong>bad</strong>), but it is cleaner.
    <ol>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git rebase singlepage/publish</code></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
